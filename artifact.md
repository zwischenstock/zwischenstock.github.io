## ePortfolio Artifact

A single artifact was created to showcase all three enhancement categories, and it takes the form of a Wildlife Zoo web application for managing data. This incorporates core features and design elements from three separate final projects â€“ the Zoo Authentication project from IT-145, the Zoo Interface project from CS-210, and the MongoDB CRUD module from CS-340. These each cover a section of a typical web application, and as each final project is written in a different language, they all will be rewritten and revised in JavaScript to power a NodeJS web server. The authentication and security will be improved, appropriate data structures and software design will be utilized to create a well-organized and effective project structure, and MongoDB will be used to efficiently store and manage the data.

As the artifact is a full web application, it offers a good opportunity to display a variety of different skills. The rewriting, revisioning, and incorporating three separate final projects onto a more coherent application provides an opportunity to display proficiency with the languages and tools, as well as software design. Appropriate data structures are used to manage the application in an organized manner, and all of the data for this web application is properly stored in a database which can more easily be scaled with an increase in usage. 

Throughout the development of the artifact, I have had to reconsider many of my initial choices when it came to the design. I had initially begun without much of an outline, but quickly came to realize it would become difficult to manage if it remained that way, and so I decided on a Model-View-Controller design which considerably improved the project structure. Another difficult area was the front-end of the web application, as I have almost zero experience working with HTML or CSS and spent a lot of time simply fine-tuning the views. That being said, it provided me with an opportunity to learn about how to properly manage data that is being sent between the server and client of a web application, in addition to how managing sessions work. The artifact has since improved to the point of being a fully functional web application, supporting full user authentication and CRUD interactions on the data, albeit the application is still rudimentary in its purpose.
